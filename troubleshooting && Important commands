why-is-df-hanging?

1. see FS is local or NFS:
#df -l

2.df was hanging when trying to statfs the keybase filesystem:\
$ strace df
...   # many lines omitted for brevity
statfs("/run/user/1000/keybase/kbfs", <--- hangs here
^Cstrace: Process 17510 detached
$ keybase logout
$ df  # doesn't hang anymore
...
$ keybase login
$ df  # still ok

3. try unmount:
umount -lf /your/mount/point

4. try restart proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc:
systemctl restart proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.mount

journaling in FS:
A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system's main part by recording the goal 
of such changes in a data structure known as a "journal", which is usually a circular log.

XFS supports metadata journaling, which facilitates quicker crash recovery.

SAR(collects and displays ALL system activities statistics.):

strace:
It is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility for Linux.

sosreport:
This command is a tool that collects configuration and diagnostic information from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.

traceroute:
uses the TCP/IP suite of protocols, and sends User Datagram Protocol packets. The header contains the Time to Live (TTL) field
It is used to monitor and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.

tcpdump:

By default tcpdump, captures only the packet headers. However, sometimes you may need to inspect the content of the packets.
$sudo tcpdump -n -A

-A option tells tcpdump to print each packet in ASCII
-n option to disable the translation || By default, tcpdump performs reverse DNS resolution on IP addresses and translates port numbers into names

Understanding the tcpdump Output:
[Timestamp] [Protocol] [Src IP].[Src Port] > [Dst IP].[Dst Port]: [Flags], [Seq], [Ack], [Win Size], [Options], [Data Length]

1) Identify the zombie processes
top -b1 -n1 | grep Z

2) Find the parent of zombie processes
ps -A -ostat,ppid | grep -e '[zZ]'| awk '{ print $2 }' | uniq | xargs ps -p

3) Send SIGCHLD signal to the parent process. This signal tells the parent process to execute the wait() system call and clean up its zombie children
kill -s SIGCHLD ppid

4) Identify if the zombie processes have been killed
top -b1 -n1 | grep Z

If there are still zombie processes then the parent process isn't programmed properly and is ignoring SIGCHLD signals.
You'll have to kill or close the zombies' parent process.
You'll have to kill or close the zombies' parent process. (Step 5)
init periodically executes the wait() system call to clean up its zombie children, so init will make short work of the zombies.

5) Kill the parent process
kill -9 ppid

===> Required Services for NFS:
nfs
nfslock
portmap 
mapd

===> process is running or not?
pgrep nginx || ps -C httpd || ps aux | egrep -i "(nginx|httpd)"

===> lvmstat command to detect whether certain areas or partitions of a logical volume are accessed more frequently than others.

===> initrd (fix)|| mkinitrd || grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

===> grub (fix)|| boot from disk => select rescue => select keyboard , language and continue to search existing root , it will be mounted /mnt/sysimage. then do "chroot /mnt/sysimage"
get shell 
then grub-install /dev/sda .
exit
reboot
