1. umask (/etc/profile)
Linux uses the following default mask and permission values: The system default permission values are 777 ( rwxrwxrwx ) for folders and 666 ( rw-rw-rw- ) for files. 
The default mask for a non-root user is 002, changing the folder permissions to 775 ( rwxrwxr-x ), and file permissions to 664 ( rw-rw-r-- ).


2. add some files to user's home while creation:
The skeleton directory is configured inside /etc/default/useradd:

SKEL=/etc/skel
You can add the config.sh file to this directory so that it is automatically added for all new users as part of their home directory.

3. login/account related things in /var/log/secure. || Keep authentication logs for both successful or failed logins,

4. To online scan new LUNs, complete the following steps:

Update the HBA driver by installing or updating the files sg3_utils-*.rpm and sg3_utils-libs-*.rpm to the latest version supplied in your Linux distribution.
Ensure that DMMP is enabled.
Ensure that the LUNS that need to be expanded are not mounted and are not used by applications.
Run sh rescan-scsi-bus.sh -r.
Run multipath -F.
Run multipath.
Run multipath -ll to view that LUN sizes are expanded successfully without a reboot.
To online expand or shrink new LUNs, complete the following steps:

Update the HBA driver by installing or updating the files sg3_utils-*.rpm and sg3_utils-libs-*.rpm to the latest version.
Ensure that DMMP is enabled.
Ensure that the LUNS that need to be expanded are not mounted and are not used by applications.
Run sh rescan-scsi-bus.sh -r.
Run multipath -F.
Run multipath.
Run multipath -ll to view that LUN sizes are expanded successfully without a reboot.

LUN set offline
On Intel based hosts running the Linux operating system, in response to errors, the kernel might permanently disable a LUN and log a message that states both device set offline and the specific device.
Maximum file system size limits volume size
For certain Linux kernels, the maximum file system size is less than the LUN maximum size supported by the system.
Failover errors
In certain cases, only the default settings load, and an error is generated in the log file.
Block scheduler performance
Some parameters might require adjustment to achieve optimal block scheduler performance.
