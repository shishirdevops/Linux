1. umask (/etc/profile)
Linux uses the following default mask and permission values: The system default permission values are 777 ( rwxrwxrwx ) for folders and 666 ( rw-rw-rw- ) for files. 
The default mask for a non-root user is 002, changing the folder permissions to 775 ( rwxrwxr-x ), and file permissions to 664 ( rw-rw-r-- ).


2. add some files to user's home while creation:
The skeleton directory is configured inside /etc/default/useradd:

SKEL=/etc/skel
You can add the config.sh file to this directory so that it is automatically added for all new users as part of their home directory.

2. login/account related things in /var/log/secure. || Keep authentication logs for both successful or failed logins,
