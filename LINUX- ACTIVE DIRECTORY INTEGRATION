where “master” is the RHEL host name and “ADserver “is the ADDS (Active directory domain service) Server name.

3. Update the DNS – /etc/resolve.conf
Set the system’s search domain and point to the AD DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf

Join the server to the domain
To join the server in domain, under the specific OU , use the below command

#net ads join createcomputer=Datacenter-FI/Linux_Servers -U <admin id>

Replace the OU names accroding to your environment (Datacenter-Fi/Linux_servers is based on my test environment).You should be having an admin ID created in the AD already to join the computer.

Restart the service
Once joined to the domain , restart the  winbind service

#systemctl restart winbind

Restrict Access only to a specific AD group
To restrict access to the server for a specific AD group is possible via editing the file /etc/security/pam_winbind.conf .

Edit the line require_membership_of  and add the SIDs of the group which needs access to this server by comma separated.

Enable the Home directory on first login
Enable oddjobd to create home directory automatically in the initial login with default permissions of 700

# authconfig –enablemkhomedir –update

Verify Your Access
We have completed the AD integration in the server. now test your access with your AD id and password.

eg: login -urid@domain and password – AD password.
