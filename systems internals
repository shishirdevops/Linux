What happens internally when we type a command in the shell 

enter command in terminal => goes to shell
shell does main 3 things:

1: parsing
breaks command in token , check shell expension (e.g. * etc), shell will check for alias, check if command built-in to shell, 
find of path of executable, search path define in $PATH
2: execute program: (/usr/bin/ls)
fork ()=> exec()=> wait()=>
