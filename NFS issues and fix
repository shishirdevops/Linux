The use of nfsstat and nfsiostat to troubleshoot NFS performance issues can make your life easy.

Issue 1:
mount: mount to NFS server 'NFS-Server' failed: System Error: No route to host.

showmount –e <NFS server IP > | grep –I  <clientIP>
telnet <NFS server IP> 2049

Error 2:
mount_nfs: can't mount / from 1.2.3.4 onto /mnt: RPC prog. not avail
Error: “mount clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure – RPC: Unable to receive”

The Linux NFS implementation requires that both the NFS service and the portmapper (RPC) service be running on both the client and the server. 
# rpcinfo -p
#systemctl status rpcbind

Error 3: 
Error: “NFS Stale File Handle”

Any program which attempts to do further I/O on the deleted file will receive the “NFS Stale File Handle” error.
To refresh the client’s state with that of the server you may do a lazy unmount the mount point and remount it
# umount -l /mnt/mount_point
or kill the process, which references the mounted file system:
# fuser -k [mounted-filesystem].

Error 4:
Error: “Access Denied” or “Permission Denied”
Check the export permissions for the NFS file system. You can do this from the client:

# showmount -e server_name

Error 5:
Error: “rpc mount export: RPC: Timed out”

Unable to access file system at [NFS SERVER]: rpc mount export: RPC: Timed out This is caused by DNS name resolution issue. NFS(RPC) needs reverse name resolution. 
If NFS server or client cannot resolve their name, this error occurs.
In case gets the error message, check DNS configuration and /etc/hosts configuration.
